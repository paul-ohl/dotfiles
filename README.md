# My dotfiles

Managed with GNU stow

## How to use

Each software is in their own directory.
Use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to create the simlinks.

The `setup.sh` script is tailored to my config, use at your own risk.
(But it should work pretty well)

## Todo for my dotfiles

### stow Setup

Ansible setup
- packages from brew (macOS and 42 computers) or pacman (arch)
- binaries from git repositories, npm and pip
- plugins for vim
- nerd fonts!

Manage favorite folders as well, should be able to customize it per machine

I will have to make a front end for vim, I'm sure it's going to be tons of fun.

notify when not used for over a week

### Xmonad

Keepassxc as a scratchpad

Software shortcuts: w for qutebrowser, p for keepass

window gaps ffs

### Alacritty

General configuration, check the bindings.

### Emacs

Read about [Hydra colors](https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/wiki/Hydra-Colors)
and make 2 hydras:
1) Moving and resizing windows
2) Moving tabs

Maybe [remap caps lock to esc AND ctrl](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/remap-caps-lock-to-escape-and-control/)?

### Nvim

[nvim-orgmode](https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode/blob/master/DOCS.md)
config.

auto-close vim after bootstrap

browse custom directories easily, improve on OpenDirectoryInTab -> create custom
pickers easily in Telescope

more convenient remaps for termdebug

Look into [Ã¼berzug](https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug) and this
[Telescope picker](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-media-files.nvim)
for linux.

if it ever gets useful: [Notifications](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify)
