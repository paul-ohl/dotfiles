# My dotfiles

Managed with GNU stow

## How to use

Each software is in their own directory.
Use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to create the simlinks.

The `setup.sh` script is tailored to my config, use at your own risk.
(But it should work pretty well)

## Todo for my dotfiles

### Nvim

[Hydra](https://github.com/anuvyklack/hydra.nvim)

Use ccls instead of clangd? Would have to manage it myself instead of with mason

Setup [LuaSnips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn800rlPIho) better.

### Linux general

Color theme? ffffff,2b2914,60cd62,1d071c,0ae60d
